“…a requirement for a good soldier is to focus, remind, and have a high degree of concentration…alien bugs are everywhere, we need to seek and destroy them…”


GAME LAYOUT
The game is structured in a four-by-four grid.  The grid will have 16 blocks, and in each block, there will be an alien bug hidden.

GAME MECHANIC
Player will need to search for the alien bugs pair hidden in the blocks.  Clicking in each block, an alien bug will be revealed; the player will need to memorize the alien color and position, trying to find the matching block with the same type/color of alien bug.  

WIN SITUATION
The player will click in two blocks finding exactly the same type of alien bug color.  In this winning case, the blocks will stay open revealing the spotted aliens.
